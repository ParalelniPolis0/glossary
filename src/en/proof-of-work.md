Proof of Work (PoW) is a [[consensus mechanism]] and spam prevention system first developed to combat email spam and later adapted for use in cryptocurrencies, most notably [[Bitcoin]]. It requires participants (often called miners) to expend computational effort solving complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks in a blockchain.

In a PoW system, miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash function with a specific level of difficulty. The first miner to find a solution that meets the required criteria broadcasts it to the network for verification. If valid, the new block is added to the blockchain, and the successful miner is rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency and transaction fees. This process serves multiple purposes: it secures the network against attacks, distributes new currency, and provides a decentralized method for reaching consensus on the state of the ledger.

While PoW has proven to be a robust and secure system for cryptocurrencies, it has faced criticism for its high energy consumption and potential for centralization as mining becomes more resource-intensive. These concerns have led to the development of alternative consensus mechanisms like [[Proof of Stake]] and explorations into more energy-efficient PoW algorithms. Despite these challenges, PoW remains a fundamental concept in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, underpinning the security and operation of many blockchain networks.
