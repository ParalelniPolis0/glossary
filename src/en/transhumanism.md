Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as pattern recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. Modern AI systems primarily use [[machine learning]] techniques, particularly deep neural networks, which learn from data to improve their performance without explicit programming.

The development of AI technology represents a fundamental shift in human capability enhancement, offering tools for automating complex tasks, augmenting human decision-making, and processing vast amounts of information. Decentralized AI approaches emphasize open-source development, distributed computing networks, and community-governed AI systems as alternatives to centralized corporate or state control of AI capabilities.

The intersection of AI with personal freedom focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, sovereign AI systems that individuals can control and customize, and the development of AI tools that enhance rather than restrict individual agency. This includes federated learning systems that keep data under user control, encryption-based AI that protects user privacy, and open-source AI models that enable independent verification and modification.
