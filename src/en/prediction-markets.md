Prediction markets are platforms where users can trade on the outcomes of future events, effectively creating a market-based forecasting system. In the cryptocurrency space, decentralized prediction markets like *Polymarket* and *Augur* allow users to bet on real-world event outcomes using cryptocurrencies, with the market prices reflecting the collective probability assessment of those events occurring.

The concept of prediction markets has existed for centuries, but blockchain technology has enabled truly decentralized and [[censorship-resistant|censorship resistance]] implementations. These platforms typically use [[smart contracts]] to automatically settle trades based on predefined outcomes, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries. Users can create markets for various events ranging from political elections and sports outcomes to economic indicators and technological developments.

Prediction markets are considered valuable tools for aggregating information and generating accurate forecasts, as they incentivize participants to bet according to their true beliefs rather than personal biases. Within the [[cryptocurrency]] ecosystem, they represent an important application of [[decentralized finance]] (DeFi) principles, combining financial markets with information discovery while maintaining user privacy and resistance to censorship through blockchain technology.
