Seasteading is the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea, particularly floating cities in international waters that operate with significant autonomy from existing nations. The modern seasteading movement was formalized with the founding of The Seasteading Institute (TSI) by Patri Friedman and Wayne Gramlich in 2008, with significant backing from Peter Thiel. The concept represents an intersection of [[libertarianism]], technological innovation, and environmental sustainability.

The core philosophy behind seasteading is to enable experimentation with new forms of [[governance]] and social organization by creating autonomous floating communities beyond the jurisdiction of existing nations. Proponents argue that seasteading could foster innovation in political and social systems, similar to how startup companies drive innovation in technology. These floating cities are envisioned as platforms for testing new approaches to government, economics, and social organization.

From a technical perspective, seasteading involves developing sustainable floating architecture that can withstand ocean conditions while providing comfortable living spaces. The movement intersects with various fields including marine engineering, [[sustainable technology]], and [[alternative energy]]. Modern seasteading proposals often emphasize environmental benefits, suggesting that floating cities could help address rising sea levels, overpopulation, and provide new approaches to *ocean conservation* and sustainable resource management.
