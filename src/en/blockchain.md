Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant record-keeping without the need for a central authority. First conceptualized by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 as the underlying technology for [[Bitcoin]], blockchain has since evolved into a broader technological framework with applications far beyond cryptocurrencies.

At its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks containing digital information, cryptographically linked and replicated across a network of computers. Each block typically contains a set of transactions or data, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, creating an immutable and auditable history. The decentralized nature of blockchain systems, coupled with [[consensus mechanisms]] like [[Proof of Work]] or [[Proof of Stake]], ensures data integrity and resistance to manipulation.

While initially associated primarily with [[cryptocurrencies]], blockchain technology has found diverse applications across industries. [[Smart contracts]], self-executing agreements with the terms directly written into code, have enabled the development of [[decentralized finance (DeFi)]] platforms and [[non-fungible tokens (NFTs)]]. Beyond finance, blockchain is being explored for use in supply chain management, voting systems, identity verification, and other fields where transparency, traceability, and trust are paramount. Despite its potential, blockchain technology faces challenges including scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory uncertainties.
