Open Hardware (also known as Open Source Hardware or OSHW) refers to physical artifacts whose design has been released to the public in such a way that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. The hardware's source files, including mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of materials, PCB layout data, HDL source code, and any software that interfaces with the hardware, must be readily available and modifiable under an open license.

The open hardware movement emerged alongside the [[open source]] software movement but focuses on physical objects rather than code. Notable examples include [[Arduino]], an open-source electronics platform, and RepRap, a self-replicating 3D printer project. This approach to hardware development promotes innovation through collaboration, enables [[decentralized manufacturing]], and provides alternatives to proprietary hardware solutions. The movement is particularly important in contexts of [[technological sovereignty]] and [[digital autonomy]], as it allows communities to understand, modify, and control the technology they use.

Open hardware plays a crucial role in parallel structures by enabling communities to build and maintain their own infrastructure without depending on centralized manufacturers or closed systems. It intersects with various movements including [[maker culture]], [[biohacking]], and [[appropriate technology]]. The philosophy behind open hardware aligns with principles of [[technological empowerment]], knowledge sharing, and resistance to vendor lock-in. This approach has been particularly influential in fields such as scientific instrumentation, medical devices, and sustainable technology development, where open access to hardware designs can accelerate innovation and reduce costs.
