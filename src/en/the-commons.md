Commons-based peer production (CBPP) is a term coined by Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler to describe a model of socio-economic production in which groups of individuals cooperate with each other to produce shared resources without traditional hierarchical organization. This system is characterized by decentralized coordination, non-monetary incentives, and the creation of commons-based resources that are freely accessible to all. The most prominent example is *Wikipedia*, but it also includes projects like *Linux* and other [[free and open-source software]].

The key characteristics of CBPP include: collaboration among large groups of individuals working cooperatively without market signals or managerial commands, the use of [[open source]] licensing to ensure resources remain freely available, and a governance structure that emerges from the community rather than being imposed from above. This model challenges traditional economic theories by demonstrating how complex, high-quality products can be created through voluntary collaboration rather than market mechanisms or corporate hierarchies.

CBPP represents a significant shift in how goods, particularly information and cultural products, can be produced in the digital age. It intersects with concepts like the [[sharing economy]], [[digital commons]], and [[peer-to-peer]] networks, demonstrating how technology enables new forms of social production. The success of CBPP projects has influenced thinking about [[alternative economics]], [[collaborative governance]], and the potential for more democratic and participatory forms of production in various sectors beyond software and content creation.
