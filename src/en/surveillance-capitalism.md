Surveillance capitalism is a term coined by Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff to describe a new economic order that claims human experiences as free raw material for commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales. This system is primarily driven by major tech companies that collect and commodify personal data for profit. Through various digital platforms and services, these companies harvest vast amounts of information about human behavior, preferences, relationships, and activities, which is then processed using [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] algorithms to create detailed predictions about future behaviors.

The core mechanism of surveillance capitalism operates through what Zuboff calls the "behavioral surplus" - the excess data collected beyond what is necessary for product improvement, which is then used to create sophisticated models for predicting and influencing human behavior. This data is not just collected through obvious means like social media posts or search histories, but also through IoT devices, smartphones, and various sensors in our environment. The collected information is then used to create targeted advertising, personalized content, and other forms of behavioral modification that serve commercial interests.

The implications of surveillance capitalism extend far beyond simple privacy concerns, representing a fundamental challenge to human autonomy and democratic society. By creating powerful systems of behavioral prediction and modification, surveillance capitalism threatens to reshape human nature itself, potentially undermining individual agency and democratic decision-making. This system has significant overlap with concerns raised by [[cypherpunk]] and [[privacy]] advocates, who warn about the dangers of centralized data collection and control. The rise of surveillance capitalism has led to increased interest in [[encryption]], [[decentralization]], and other technological solutions that can help protect individual privacy and autonomy from commercial surveillance.
