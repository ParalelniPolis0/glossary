A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier recorded on a [[blockchain]] that certifies the ownership and authenticity of a specific digital asset. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as [[Bitcoin]], which are fungible (meaning each unit is identical and interchangeable), NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. This technology enables digital scarcity and verifiable ownership of digital assets, including artwork, music, videos, virtual real estate, and other forms of digital content.

The rise of NFTs has significantly impacted the digital art world by providing artists with new ways to monetize their work and collectors with verifiable ownership of digital pieces. This technology addresses a long-standing challenge in digital art: the ability to establish scarcity and authenticity in an environment where digital files can be easily copied. Through [[smart contracts]] on blockchain platforms like [[Ethereum]], NFTs can also enable artists to receive royalties automatically whenever their work is resold in the secondary market.

NFTs represent a convergence of [[cryptography]], digital art, and blockchain technology, embodying many principles of the [[cypherpunk]] movement regarding digital ownership and individual sovereignty. The technology has sparked discussions about the future of digital property rights, the nature of ownership in the digital age, and the democratization of art markets. While initially associated primarily with digital art, NFTs have expanded to include applications in gaming ([[GameFi]]), identity verification, and various forms of digital collectibles, demonstrating their potential to reshape how we think about digital assets and ownership.
