Mass surveillance refers to the widespread, often covert monitoring of large populations' communications, movements, and activities by governments, corporations, or other entities. This practice has existed for centuries but has dramatically expanded in scope and sophistication with the advent of digital technologies and the internet. Modern mass surveillance employs a variety of methods, including intercepting telecommunications, [[monitoring internet activity|internet surveillance]], and collecting [[biometric data|biometrics]].

Proponents argue that mass surveillance is necessary for national security, crime prevention, and counterterrorism efforts. Programs like the NSA's [[PRISM]] in the United States and China's [[Golden Shield Project]] exemplify large-scale government surveillance initiatives. However, these practices have sparked intense debate about the balance between security and [[privacy rights]], with critics arguing that mass surveillance threatens civil liberties, chills free speech, and can lead to abuse of power.

The global discourse on mass surveillance gained significant momentum following the [2013 revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) by [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), which exposed the extent of surveillance programs conducted by the [[Five Eyes]] intelligence alliance. These disclosures led to increased public awareness, legal challenges, and efforts to develop stronger [[encryption]] and privacy-preserving technologies. The ongoing tension between surveillance practices and privacy rights continues to shape policy debates, technological development, and international relations in the digital age.
