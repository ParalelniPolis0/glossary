Biohacking is a broad movement focused on optimizing human biology and performance through technological and biological interventions. It encompasses various approaches, from DIY biology and self-experimentation to lifestyle optimization and technological augmentation. The term emerged in the early 2000s and has since grown into a global movement that combines elements of [[citizen science]], [[self-quantification]], and human enhancement.

The biohacking movement can be divided into several distinct but overlapping categories: DIY biology (conducting biological experiments outside traditional institutions), lifestyle optimization (using data and interventions to improve health and performance), and the [[grinder movement]] (body modification through technological implants). Practitioners range from citizen scientists working in community labs to individuals tracking their biomarkers and experimenting with supplements, diet, and exercise protocols to achieve optimal performance.

The movement raises important questions about democratizing science, personal autonomy, and the future of human enhancement. While some biohackers focus on accessible health optimization through nutrition and lifestyle changes, others push boundaries with genetic experimentation and cybernetic implants. This has led to ongoing debates about safety, ethics, and regulation in the field. The movement intersects with other philosophies like [[transhumanism]] and has influenced discussions about the future of healthcare, scientific research, and human evolution.
