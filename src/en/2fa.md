Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security process that requires users to provide two distinct forms of identification to access resources, data, or systems. This additional layer of security goes beyond the traditional username and password combination by requiring a second verification method, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or accounts.

The two factors in 2FA typically come from different categories: something you know (like a password), something you have (like a phone or security key), or something you are (biometric data like fingerprints). Common implementations include receiving a code via SMS, using an authenticator app, or employing a physical security key. This multi-layered approach means that even if one factor is compromised (such as a password being stolen), an attacker would still need the second factor to gain access.

2FA has become increasingly important in the [[digital security]] landscape as a defense against various cyber threats, including [[phishing]] attacks, credential stuffing, and password breaches. It is widely recommended by security experts and has been adopted by many organizations and online services as a standard security measure. The concept is part of the broader [[multi-factor authentication]] (MFA) family, which can involve three or more factors for even stronger security. In the context of [[cryptocurrency]] and blockchain applications, 2FA is often a crucial component of securing digital wallets and exchange accounts.
