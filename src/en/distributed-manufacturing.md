Distributed Manufacturing, also known as distributed production or local manufacturing, is a form of decentralized manufacturing system where products are manufactured close to their final destination using a network of geographically dispersed facilities connected through information technology. This approach stands in contrast to the traditional centralized manufacturing model where products are mass-produced in large factories and then shipped globally. The concept has gained significant momentum with the advent of [[3D Printing]], [[Digital Fabrication]], and other [[Advanced Manufacturing]] technologies that enable small-scale, flexible production.

The core principles of distributed manufacturing align closely with [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[decentralization]] philosophies. By leveraging [[digital fabrication]] technologies like [[3D printing]], CNC machines, and laser cutting, communities can create local manufacturing hubs or [[makerspaces]] that produce goods on-demand. This model reduces transportation costs, decreases environmental impact, enables rapid prototyping, and allows for greater customization of products to meet local needs. It also promotes [[resilience]] by reducing dependency on global supply chains and creating redundancy in manufacturing capabilities.

The movement intersects with various other concepts such as [[Open Source Hardware]], [[Circular Economy]], and [[Industry 4.0]]. It empowers individuals and communities to become producers rather than just consumers, fostering [[DIY culture]] and [[local resilience]]. Projects like *RepRap* (self-replicating 3D printers) and initiatives such as [[FabLabs]] demonstrate how distributed manufacturing can democratize production and enable communities to achieve greater self-sufficiency. This manufacturing paradigm is particularly relevant to *parallel structures* as it provides a framework for creating alternative production systems outside traditional industrial structures.
