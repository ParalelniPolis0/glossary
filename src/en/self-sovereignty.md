Self-sovereignty is a concept that emphasizes individual control and ownership over one's identity and personal data without relying on centralized third-party authorities. In the digital realm, this manifests as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a model that gives individuals full ownership of their digital identities, allowing them to manage and share their personal information on their own terms while maintaining privacy and security.

The concept builds on fundamental principles of human rights and individual autonomy, extending them into the digital sphere. It represents a shift away from traditional centralized identity systems where governments, corporations, or other institutions act as gatekeepers of personal information. Instead, self-sovereignty empowers individuals to be the ultimate arbiters of their own data, deciding what information to share, with whom, and under what circumstances, while maintaining the ability to revoke access at any time.

Self-sovereignty is often implemented through [[blockchain]] technology and [[cryptography]], which enable secure, decentralized systems for identity management. This approach aligns with [[cypherpunk]] ideals and supports the creation of [[parallel structures]] that operate independently of traditional institutional frameworks. The concept has broad implications for [[privacy]], [[digital freedom]], and [[governance]], as it challenges existing power structures and promotes a more equitable distribution of control over personal information in the digital age.
