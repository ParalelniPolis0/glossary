Encryption is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. It converts data into a form that appears random to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key. Encryption is a fundamental component of data security and privacy in the digital age, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, interception, and tampering.

At its core, encryption relies on complex mathematical algorithms called [ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher). Modern encryption methods typically use a [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)) to determine how the information is encoded and decoded. There are two main types of encryption: [[symmetric-key encryption]], where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, and [[public-key encryption]], where a public key is used to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it. 

Encryption plays a crucial role in various aspects of digital life, including secure communication ([[HTTPS]], [[end-to-end encryption]], data storage ([[full disk encryption]]), and authentication processes. It's also fundamental to technologies like [[virtual private networks (VPNs)]] and [[cryptocurrencies]]. As digital threats evolve, so do encryption methods, with ongoing research into [[quantum-resistant encryption]] to prepare for future challenges. Despite its importance for privacy and security, encryption remains a topic of debate, with ongoing discussions about [[encryption policies|crypto wars]] and law enforcement access.
