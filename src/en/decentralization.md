Decentralization is the process of distributing power, control, and functions away from central authorities to a network of individual participants. In its purest form, decentralization eliminates single points of failure or control, creating systems that are more resilient, censorship-resistant, and immune to manipulation. This concept can be applied to various domains including technology, organizations, economies, and social structures.

In technological contexts, decentralization manifests through [[peer-to-peer]] networks, [[blockchain]] systems, and [[distributed computing]]. These systems operate without central servers or controlling entities, instead relying on networks of equal participants who collectively maintain and validate the system. Examples include [[Bitcoin]], [[IPFS]], and [[mesh networks]], where each participant contributes to and benefits from the network's functionality without depending on central authorities.

Beyond technology, decentralization represents a fundamental shift in how human systems can organize. It enables [[self-sovereignty]], where individuals maintain control over their own data, identity, and resources. Decentralized [[governance]] models, such as [[DAOs]] (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), demonstrate how collective decision-making can occur without hierarchical structures. This approach often leads to greater innovation, resilience, and individual empowerment while reducing risks associated with centralized points of failure.
