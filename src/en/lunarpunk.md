Lunarpunk is an emerging philosophical and aesthetic movement that builds upon the foundations of [[cyberpunk]] and [[solarpunk]], with a focus on privacy, anonymity, and resilience in a world of ubiquitous surveillance. The term combines "lunar", evoking darkness and mystery, with "punk", signifying a rebellious and alternative approach to societal norms.

At its core, Lunarpunk envisions a future where privacy-enhancing technologies and decentralized systems enable individuals to operate freely in the shadows of digital and physical realms. It embraces the use of [[encryption]], [[anonymous networks]], and [[off-grid living]] as means to resist centralized control and surveillance. Aesthetically, Lunarpunk often incorporates imagery of night, shadows, and celestial bodies, symbolizing the hidden and the mysterious.

The Lunarpunk ethos extends beyond technology to encompass sustainable living practices that operate independently of mainstream systems. It promotes resilience through local, [[decentralized communities|decentralization]] and [[mutual aid networks|mutual aid]]. While solarpunk focuses on visible, sustainable futures, Lunarpunk explores the potential of hidden, resilient systems that thrive in the metaphorical darkness. This philosophy resonates with those seeking alternatives to pervasive digital surveillance and centralized control, offering a vision of a future where privacy and individual autonomy are preserved through technological and social means.
