Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for self-governed societies based on voluntary associations. It opposes all involuntary, coercive hierarchy and authority, including but not limited to the state. Instead of centralized power structures, anarchism proposes horizontal organization, mutual aid, and direct action as means of organizing society. The term derives from the Ancient Greek "anarchos," meaning "without rulers."

Core principles of anarchism include [[individual autonomy]], voluntary cooperation, mutual aid, and [[decentralization]]. Anarchists believe that social cooperation should arise through free agreement rather than being imposed by authority. They emphasize [[direct action]] and self-organization as practical methods for achieving social change, often implementing parallel structures and alternative institutions rather than trying to reform existing hierarchical systems.

While often mischaracterized as chaos, anarchism has a rich theoretical foundation and diverse practical applications. Various strands exist, including [[mutualism]], which focuses on reciprocal exchange; [[crypto-anarchism]], which applies cryptographic technology to ensure individual liberty; [[agorism]], which promotes counter-economics; and numerous other approaches that share the common goal of maximizing human freedom while opposing centralized control. Modern anarchist practices often incorporate [[decentralized technologies]], [[peer-to-peer]] networks, and alternative economic systems.
