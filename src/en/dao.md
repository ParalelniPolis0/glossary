A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a novel form of organizational structure that operates without traditional hierarchical management, instead using [[blockchain]] technology and [[smart contracts]] to enable collective decision-making and automated execution of rules. DAOs are governed by their members who typically hold governance tokens that grant them voting rights on proposals, treasury management, and organizational changes. The organization's rules and transaction records are transparently stored on a blockchain, making them publicly verifiable.

The core innovation of DAOs lies in their ability to coordinate activities and resources without requiring trust in central authorities. All rules and financial transactions are encoded in smart contracts - self-executing programs that automatically implement decisions once predetermined conditions are met. This creates a transparent and tamper-resistant framework for collective action, where members can participate in governance regardless of their geographic location or institutional affiliations. Members typically acquire governance rights by purchasing or earning the DAO's native tokens.

DAOs represent an experiment in [[digital governance]] and organizational design, combining elements of [[direct democracy]], [[game theory]], and [[cryptography]]. They have been used to coordinate various activities including investment funds, charitable organizations, software development, and content creation. While promising greater transparency and participation, DAOs also face challenges around legal recognition, security vulnerabilities (as demonstrated by "The DAO" hack in 2016), and effective coordination of large groups. The technology continues to evolve as communities experiment with different governance models and use cases.
