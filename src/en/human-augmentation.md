Human Augmentation refers to the development and application of technologies that aim to enhance human physical, cognitive, and sensory capabilities beyond their natural limitations. This field encompasses a wide range of technologies, from relatively simple devices like cochlear implants to more advanced innovations such as [[brain-computer interfaces]], genetic engineering, and [[artificial intelligence]] integration. The goal is to improve human abilities and quality of life through technological means.

The concept of human augmentation is closely tied to [[transhumanism]] and [[biohacking]] movements, which advocate for the ethical use of technology to enhance human capabilities. Current applications include medical devices for restoring lost functions, wearable technology for improving physical performance, and cognitive enhancement through various means. This field raises important ethical questions about the nature of human enhancement, accessibility of these technologies, and their potential impact on society.

As technology continues to advance, human augmentation is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with developments in areas such as [[neural implants]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[artificial organs]]. The field represents a convergence of multiple disciplines, including biotechnology, robotics, and computer science. While offering tremendous potential benefits, it also presents challenges related to safety, privacy, equity, and the fundamental nature of human identity. The development of these technologies is often accompanied by debates about their societal implications.
