The Cyphernomicon is a comprehensive document written by [Timothy C. May](/p/timothy-c-may) in 1994 that serves as both a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) and manifesto for the [[Cypherpunk]] movement. Released as version 0.666, it outlines the fundamental ideas, principles, and technical aspects behind the cypherpunk philosophy and [[crypto-anarchy]]. The document has become one of the foundational texts of the cypherpunk movement, alongside the [[Crypto Anarchist Manifesto]].

The document covers a wide range of topics including cryptography, privacy, digital money, anonymous communications, and the social implications of these technologies. It explores how encryption and digital technologies could reshape society by enabling new forms of social and economic organization outside traditional state control. The Cyphernomicon also discusses practical aspects of implementing crypto systems and the potential future impacts of widespread encryption adoption.

As a historical document, the Cyphernomicon provides valuable insights into the early thinking of the cypherpunk movement and many of its predictions about digital privacy, [[cryptocurrency]], and online anonymity have proven prescient. The document's influence can be seen in many modern privacy-focused and decentralized technologies, including [[Bitcoin]] and other blockchain-based systems. Its anti-democratic and anti-establishment themes continue to resonate within crypto-anarchist and digital freedom movements today.
