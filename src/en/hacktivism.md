Hacktivism combines hacking with activism, using digital tools and computer networks to promote political ideals, freedom of speech, and human rights. Hacktivists employ various techniques including website defacement, information leaks, distributed denial-of-service ([[DDoS]]) actions, and creation of [[privacy]]-enhancing tools to advance social, ideological, and political causes. Notable hacktivist campaigns have exposed corruption, challenged censorship, and supported protest movements worldwide.

Hacktivist methodologies often focus on ensuring access to information and protecting digital rights. This includes developing tools for [[encryption]], [[anonymous communication]], and [[information sharing]]. Hacktivists frequently create and maintain systems that enable [[whistleblowing]], circumvent [[censorship]], and protect digital privacy. The movement emphasizes the importance of technological empowerment and information freedom as fundamental human rights.

The evolution of hacktivism has significantly influenced modern digital resistance and [[cyber-autonomy]]. It has contributed to the development of important tools and technologies, including [[Tor]], [[SecureDrop]], and various [[encryption]] tools. Hacktivist principles have become increasingly relevant in an era of [[digital surveillance|mass-surveillance]] and control, inspiring new forms of technological resistance and digital [[direct action]].
