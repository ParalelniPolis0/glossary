Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that emerged in the 1980s, characterized by its focus on "high tech, low life" - a combination of advanced technology and societal breakdown. The genre typically features a dystopian future where society is dominated by powerful corporations, ubiquitous technology, and cybernetic body modifications, while ordinary people struggle to survive in the margins. The term was coined by author Bruce Bethke in his 1983 short story "Cyberpunk," but the genre was popularized by writers like William Gibson, particularly through his novel "Neuromancer" (1984).

The aesthetic and themes of cyberpunk have deeply influenced modern culture, technology, and art. Common elements include artificial intelligence, virtual reality, hackers, megacorporations, and themes of resistance against technological control. The genre often explores the relationship between humanity and technology, questioning what it means to be human in a world where the line between organic and artificial becomes increasingly blurred. These themes have resonated strongly with various counter-cultural movements, including the [[cypherpunk]] movement, which shares similar concerns about privacy, corporate power, and technological autonomy.

Cyberpunk has evolved beyond literature into a broader cultural phenomenon, influencing fashion, music, film (like "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix"), and even architecture and urban planning. Its influence can be seen in contemporary discussions about [[artificial intelligence]], [[surveillance capitalism]], and [[digital privacy]]. The movement's aesthetic and philosophical elements have become particularly relevant in the modern era, as many of its once-fictional concepts have become reality, from widespread surveillance and corporate dominance to human augmentation and virtual worlds.
