Privacy is the right of an individual or group to control information about themselves and determine when, how, and to what extent this information is communicated to others. In the digital age, privacy has become increasingly complex and crucial, encompassing not only physical space but also digital data and online activities.

At its core, privacy is about personal autonomy and the ability to make choices free from observation or interference. It includes concepts like [[information privacy]] (control over personal data), [[communications privacy]] (freedom from surveillance of communications), and [[bodily privacy|physical privacy]] (control over one's physical self). In the digital realm, privacy concerns extend to [[data collection]], [[online tracking]], and the use of personal information by governments and corporations.

Privacy is protected by various legal frameworks, including the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) and specific legislation like the [EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation). However, it faces significant challenges in the era of big data, social media, and [[mass surveillance]]. The balance between privacy and other interests, such as national security or technological innovation, remains a subject of ongoing debate. Privacy-enhancing technologies, including [[encryption]]), [[anonymity networks]], and [[privacy-preserving computation]], are increasingly important tools for protecting individual privacy in the digital world.
