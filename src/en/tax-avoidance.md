Tax avoidance refers to the legal practice of arranging one's financial affairs to minimize tax liability within the bounds of the law. Unlike [[tax evasion]], which is illegal, tax avoidance utilizes legitimate methods to reduce tax obligations through careful financial planning, use of tax deductions, credits, and other legal mechanisms. This practice is commonly used by individuals and corporations as part of their financial strategy, though it often operates in a grey area between fully compliant tax practices and the [[shadow economy]].

The concept plays a significant role in discussions about [[parallel economies]] and alternative financial systems. While legal, tax avoidance has become increasingly controversial, particularly in the context of multinational corporations using sophisticated methods like profit shifting and offshore arrangements. This has led to international initiatives like the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, which aims to address tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations.

In the context of [[crypto-anarchism]] and [[alternative economies]], tax avoidance often intersects with discussions about financial sovereignty and the relationship between individuals and state authority. The rise of [[cryptocurrencies]] and [[decentralized finance]] has introduced new dimensions to tax avoidance, as these technologies can facilitate both legal tax optimization strategies and illegal tax evasion schemes, highlighting the ongoing tension between financial privacy and regulatory compliance.
