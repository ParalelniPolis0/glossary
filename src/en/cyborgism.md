Cyborgism represents the integration of technology with human biology and consciousness, embracing the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines. It goes beyond mere tool use, suggesting that technology can become a fundamental part of human identity and capability. This philosophy views technological augmentation not as artificial, but as a natural evolution of human potential and [[self-sovereignty]].

The cyborg perspective challenges traditional boundaries between natural and artificial, viewing technology as an extension of human capabilities rather than something separate from humanity. This includes both physical augmentations ([[biohacking]], [[body modification]]) and cognitive enhancements through digital technologies. Modern examples include everyday technologies like smartphones, which effectively function as external memory and processing systems, and more direct interventions like [[neural implants]] and [[sensory enhancement]] devices.

Cyborgism intersects with various movements including [[transhumanism]], [[biohacking]], and [[human augmentation]]. It emphasizes individual autonomy over one's own body and mind, including the freedom to modify and enhance oneself using technology. This philosophy has implications for [[digital identity]], [[privacy]], and human rights in an increasingly technologically integrated world, raising questions about the future of human evolution and consciousness.
