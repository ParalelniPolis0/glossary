Nootropics, also known as "smart drugs" or "cognitive enhancers," are natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic compounds that aim to improve cognitive function, particularly executive functions, memory, creativity, or motivation in healthy individuals. The term was coined by Romanian psychologist Corneliu E. Giurgea in 1972, who established several criteria for what constitutes a nootropic, including the enhancement of learning capabilities, resistance to disrupting brain conditions, and very few side effects.

These substances can be broadly categorized into two main types: natural nootropics (like *caffeine*, *L-theanine*, and various herbal compounds) and synthetic nootropics (such as *modafinil*, *piracetam*, and other prescription medications). Natural nootropics are often derived from plants and have been used in traditional medicine systems for centuries, while synthetic nootropics are laboratory-created compounds designed specifically for cognitive enhancement. The field of [[biohacking]] has embraced nootropics as tools for optimizing mental performance and achieving enhanced states of consciousness.

The use of nootropics intersects with various movements focused on human enhancement, including the [[transhumanism]] movement and [[DIY biology]] communities. While proponents argue for their benefits in improving productivity and cognitive capabilities, there are ongoing debates about their safety, efficacy, and ethical implications. The long-term effects of many nootropics remain understudied, and their use raises important questions about [[cognitive liberty]], human enhancement ethics, and the future of human performance optimization.
