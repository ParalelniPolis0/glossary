Post-State Governance Models refer to alternative systems of social and political organization that aim to transcend traditional nation-state structures through decentralized, networked, and often technology-enabled forms of governance. These models explore how communities can organize, make decisions, and provide services traditionally associated with states (such as security, dispute resolution, and public goods) without relying on centralized state authority.

These governance models often incorporate elements of [[decentralized autonomous organizations]] (DAOs), [[smart contracts]], and other blockchain-based systems to create transparent, programmable rule sets that can govern interactions between participants. Some examples include private cities, [[seasteading]], digital jurisdictions, and various forms of market anarchism. These systems typically emphasize voluntary association, individual sovereignty, and the ability to exit or choose between competing governance providers.

The development of post-state governance models is closely tied to technological advancement, particularly in [[cryptography]], [[blockchain]], and digital communications. These technologies enable new forms of coordination, consensus-building, and resource allocation that weren't possible in traditional state structures. While many of these models remain theoretical or experimental, they represent important explorations into how society might organize itself in an increasingly digital and interconnected world where traditional national boundaries and centralized authority structures may become less relevant.
