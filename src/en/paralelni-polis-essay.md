"Paralelní Polis" (Parallel Polis) is an influential essay written by Czech philosopher and political dissident [Václav Benda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Benda) in 1978. The essay introduced the concept of creating parallel structures within society as a means of resistance against totalitarian regimes, particularly in the context of *Communist Czechoslovakia*. Benda's work became a foundational text for the *Czech dissident movement* (Charta 77) and had a significant impact on political thought in Eastern Europe.

The core idea of the essay is that citizens should establish independent social, cultural, and economic institutions that operate outside the control of the authoritarian state. These parallel structures would serve as alternatives to official institutions, allowing people to live more freely and authentically while gradually eroding the power of the oppressive regime. Benda argued that this approach could create a "parallel polis" - a shadow society that embodies the values and freedoms suppressed by the totalitarian government.

The concept of Paralelní Polis influenced the development of civil society in Eastern Europe during the late 20th century and played a role in the peaceful resistance that ultimately led to the fall of communism in the region. The essay's ideas continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about grassroots organizing, decentralized systems, and resistance to authoritarian power structures. Today, the concept has been adopted by various groups seeking to create alternative social and economic models, including [[cryptocurrency]] advocates and proponents of decentralized technologies.
