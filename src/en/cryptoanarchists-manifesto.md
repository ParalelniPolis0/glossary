The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto is a seminal document written by [Timothy C. May](/p/timothy-c-may) in 1988 that laid the philosophical foundation for the [[crypto-anarchy]] movement and influenced the broader [[cypherpunk]] ideology. The manifesto predicted how [[cryptography]] and digital technologies would fundamentally transform the nature of corporations and government interference in economic transactions. It envisioned a future where cryptographic software would allow individuals to freely interact and conduct business anonymously, beyond state control.

The document begins with the famous line "A specter is haunting the modern world - the specter of crypto anarchy" (an allusion to The Communist Manifesto), and goes on to describe how the combination of [[cryptography]] and digital money would create a new borderless market system operating outside traditional state boundaries. May argued that these technologies would shift power from centralized institutions back to individuals, enabling truly free markets and private, voluntary interactions while making government regulation and taxation increasingly difficult to enforce.

The manifesto proved remarkably prescient, anticipating many developments that would later emerge with [[Bitcoin]] and other [[cryptocurrencies]], [[smart contracts]], and [[decentralized systems]]. Its ideas heavily influenced early [[cypherpunk]] discussions and helped spark a movement dedicated to developing privacy-enhancing technologies and digital currency systems. The document remains highly relevant today as society grapples with questions of [[privacy]], [[surveillance|mass surveillance]], and the role of state power in the digital age.
