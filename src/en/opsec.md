Operations Security (OpSec) is a systematic process and set of practices designed to protect critical information and prevent potential adversaries from gaining access to sensitive data or operations. Originally developed as a military concept during the Vietnam War under the codename "Purple Dragon," OpSec has since evolved to become a crucial component of both governmental and civilian security practices. The core principle of OpSec is identifying and protecting information that could be pieced together by adversaries to gain insights into protected activities or systems.

OpSec follows a five-step process: identifying critical information, analyzing threats, analyzing vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing countermeasures. This methodology helps organizations and individuals maintain [[privacy]] and security by controlling the information they reveal through their actions and communications. In the context of [[crypto-anarchism]] and [[cypherpunk]] movements, OpSec practices are essential for protecting [[digital privacy]], maintaining [[anonymity]], and securing [[cryptocurrency]] assets.

In the modern digital age, OpSec has become increasingly important as threats have evolved beyond traditional military applications to include cybersecurity, personal privacy, and protection against [[surveillance|mass surveillance]]. It encompasses both technical security measures (like [[encryption]], [[secure communications]], and [[digital signatures]]) and behavioral practices (such as social media awareness, physical security, and information compartmentalization). For practitioners of parallel structures and alternative systems, strong OpSec is fundamental to maintaining independence from traditional power structures while protecting sensitive activities and information.
