Proof of Stake (PoS) is a [[consensus mechanism]] used in [[blockchain]] networks to validate transactions and create new blocks. Unlike [[Proof of Work]], which relies on computational power, PoS selects validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" or lock up as collateral in the network. This approach is significantly more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly compared to traditional mining methods.

The PoS mechanism works by having participants (called validators) lock up a certain amount of tokens as stake in the network. The probability of being chosen to validate the next block is generally proportional to the amount staked - the more tokens staked, the higher the chance of being selected. If validators approve fraudulent transactions, they can lose part or all of their staked tokens, creating a strong economic incentive for honest behavior.

This consensus mechanism has gained significant attention since [[Ethereum]]'s transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake (known as "The Merge"). Other notable [[blockchain]] platforms using PoS include Cardano, Solana, and Polkadot. The adoption of PoS represents a shift in the cryptocurrency industry towards more sustainable and scalable solutions, though it faces its own challenges regarding centralization risks, as those with more tokens naturally have more influence over the network.
