Decentralized Applications (dApps) are software applications that run on [[peer-to-peer]] networks rather than centralized servers, eliminating single points of control and failure. Unlike traditional applications where code and data are controlled by a single entity, dApps operate on distributed networks where users retain control of their data and interactions, with core functionality typically implemented through [[smart contract]] and peer-to-peer protocols.

The key characteristics of dApps include open-source code, cryptographic consensus mechanisms, and token-based incentives that align network participants' interests. Common examples include decentralized exchanges, social media platforms, marketplaces, and gaming environments where users can interact directly without intermediaries. These applications often integrate [[cryptocurrency]] for value transfer and [[digital signature|digital signatures]] for user authentication.

dApps represent a paradigm shift in software architecture, enabling the creation of parallel digital infrastructure that operates independently of traditional corporate or institutional control. By combining peer-to-peer networks, cryptographic primitives, and economic incentives, dApps create resilient systems where users maintain sovereignty over their data, assets, and interactions while participating in community-governed digital spaces.
