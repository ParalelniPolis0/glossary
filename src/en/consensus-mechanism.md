A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant protocol used in [[blockchain]] systems and distributed computing to achieve agreement on a single data value or state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems. In the context of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the ledger.

The most well-known consensus mechanisms include [[Proof of Work (PoW)]], used by [[Bitcoin]], and [[Proof of Stake (PoS)]], employed by [[Ethereum]] and other cryptocurrencies. Other notable mechanisms include *Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)*, *Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)*, and *Proof of Authority (PoA)*. Each mechanism has its own set of trade-offs in terms of security, decentralization, scalability, and energy efficiency.

Consensus mechanisms play a crucial role in solving the [[Byzantine Generals' Problem|Byzantine fault]] in distributed systems, ensuring that the network can reach agreement even in the presence of malicious actors or faulty nodes. The choice of consensus mechanism significantly impacts a blockchain's performance, security model, and overall design. As the field evolves, researchers and developers continue to explore new consensus algorithms to address limitations of existing models and to meet the specific needs of various blockchain applications.
