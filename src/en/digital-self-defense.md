Digital Self-Defense refers to the practices and techniques individuals use to protect their [[digital privacy]], security, and personal information in the face of increasing online threats and [[surveillance|mass surveillance]]. It encompasses a wide range of skills and tools designed to safeguard one's digital presence, communications, and data from unauthorized access, manipulation, or exploitation.

At its core, Digital Self-Defense is about empowering individuals to take control of their digital lives. This includes understanding and mitigating risks associated with [[online tracking]], [[data collection]], and cyber attacks. Key aspects of Digital Self-Defense include the use of [[encryption]] for secure communications, [[mixnets]] or [[virtual private networks (VPNs)]] for anonymous browsing, [[two-factor authentication]] for account security, and [[digital hygiene]] practices like regular software updates and strong password management.

The concept of Digital Self-Defense has gained prominence with the rise of [[mass surveillance]], [[data breaches]], and sophisticated cyber threats. It's closely related to the idea of [[information self-determination]], which asserts an individual's right to control the collection and use of their personal data. As digital technologies become increasingly integrated into daily life, Digital Self-Defense is becoming an essential skill for maintaining personal freedom, privacy, and security in the digital age.
