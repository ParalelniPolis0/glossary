Off-grid living refers to a lifestyle characterized by independence from centralized utilities and systems. It involves creating self-sufficient living spaces that operate without reliance on public infrastructure for electricity, water, food, or other essential resources. This approach emphasizes [[self-sovereignty]] and resilience through the use of independent systems and sustainable practices.

The core components of off-grid living typically include [[renewable energy]] systems (such as solar, wind, or micro-hydro), water collection and purification systems, food production methods, and waste management solutions. Modern off-grid setups often incorporate advanced technologies like [[battery storage]], [[smart power management]], and efficient appliances, demonstrating that independence from centralized systems doesn't mean sacrificing modern comforts.

Off-grid living represents a practical implementation of [[decentralization]] principles in everyday life. It intersects with concepts like [[permaculture]], [[circular economy]], and [[resilient communities]]. Beyond individual households, off-grid principles can scale to larger communities and networks, creating interconnected systems of independent units that support each other while maintaining autonomy from centralized infrastructure.
