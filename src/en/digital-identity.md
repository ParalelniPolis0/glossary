Digital identity is a set of attributes and claims that represent an entity in digital environments, enabling authentication and interaction without revealing unnecessary personal information. In the context of parallel structures, digital identity emphasizes [[self-sovereignty]], where individuals maintain complete control over their identity data without relying on centralized authorities or traditional identity providers.

The cypherpunk approach to digital identity leverages cryptographic primitives like [[public key cryptography]], [[zero-knowledge proofs]], and [[digital signatures]] to enable secure, pseudonymous interactions. These technologies allow individuals to prove specific attributes about themselves (age, membership, credentials) without revealing their full identity, following the principle of minimal disclosure and maintaining maximum privacy.

Digital identity systems built on [[blockchain]] networks and peer-to-peer protocols enable users to create multiple contextual identities, manage their reputation across different environments, and participate in [[DAO]] and other parallel structures without traditional identity documents. This approach supports resistance against surveillance, enables privacy-preserving commerce, and allows for the creation of autonomous communities independent of legacy identity systems.
