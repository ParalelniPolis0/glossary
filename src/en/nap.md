The Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) is a fundamental ethical principle that states that no one may threaten or commit violence ("aggress") against another person's life, body, or property. It is considered a defining principle of [[libertarianism]] and [[anarcho-capitalism]], serving as an ethical foundation for advocating individual rights, private property, and voluntary interaction between people.

The principle defines aggression as the initiation or threat of physical violence against a person or their property, making a clear distinction between defensive and offensive use of force. Under NAP, defensive force is considered legitimate when used to protect oneself or one's property from aggression. This principle is closely tied to the concept of [[self-ownership]] and extends to the idea that individuals have absolute right to their body and legitimately acquired property.

While widely embraced in libertarian circles, the NAP has sparked philosophical debates about its scope, interpretation, and practical application. Critics argue about edge cases and definitional challenges, such as what constitutes aggression, how property rights should be defined, and how the principle applies to complex real-world scenarios. Despite these debates, the NAP remains influential in shaping discussions about individual rights, the role of government, and the ethical foundations of a free society.
