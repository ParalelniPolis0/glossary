Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a distributed network architecture where participants (peers) share resources directly with each other without requiring central coordination. In a P2P network, each node can act as both client and server, enabling direct exchange of data, processing power, or other resources between participants. This decentralized approach stands in contrast to traditional client-server models where clients must interact through centralized servers.

The history of P2P technology gained mainstream attention in the late 1990s with file-sharing applications like [[Napster]], though the concept dates back to early internet protocols. P2P networks demonstrate several key advantages including improved scalability (as network capacity grows with each new peer), enhanced resilience (no single point of failure), and cost efficiency (shared resources reduce infrastructure needs). Notable applications include [[BitTorrent]] for file sharing, [[Bitcoin]] and other [[cryptocurrencies]] for financial transactions, and [[distributed computing]] projects.

P2P architecture has become fundamental to many modern [[decentralized applications]] (dApps) and [[blockchain]] technologies. The technology enables creation of resilient systems that operate without central authority, aligning with principles of [[digital freedom]] and [[decentralization]]. P2P networks continue to evolve with applications in content distribution, communication systems, and [[distributed storage]], though they also face challenges around security, legal compliance, and quality of service management.
