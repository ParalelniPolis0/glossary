Decentralized Finance (DeFi) refers to an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by [[cryptocurrencies]]. It's a system that removes traditional centralized intermediaries like banks and financial institutions from financial transactions, replacing them with [[smart contracts]] on [[blockchain]] networks. This revolutionary approach aims to create an open, permissionless, and transparent financial system accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

The core components of DeFi include decentralized exchanges ([[DEX]]), lending platforms, [[stablecoins]], and various financial instruments that operate without traditional intermediaries. These applications are typically built on [[Ethereum]] or other blockchain platforms that support smart contracts, allowing users to trade, lend, borrow, and invest their digital assets in a trustless manner. The system relies on [[cryptography]] and consensus mechanisms to ensure security and validate transactions.

DeFi has experienced significant growth since its emergence, particularly during 2020-2021, revolutionizing traditional financial services through innovation in areas like [[yield farming]], [[liquidity mining]], and [[flash loans]]. However, it also faces challenges related to scalability, security risks, regulatory compliance, and potential systemic risks. The technology continues to evolve, with new protocols and applications being developed to address these challenges while expanding the possibilities of decentralized financial services.
