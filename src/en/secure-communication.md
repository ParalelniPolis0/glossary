Secure communication refers to the practice of exchanging information between parties in a way that prevents unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. It is a fundamental concept in [[privacy]] and [[information security]], built upon principles established by the [[cypherpunk]] movement and modern [[cryptography]]. The core elements of secure communication include [[end-to-end encryption]], [[forward secrecy]], and methods to verify the authenticity of participants in a conversation.

Popular tools for secure communication include [[Signal]], [[Matrix]], and **Briar**, which implement various security protocols to protect users' privacy. These applications typically employ multiple layers of security, including [[public-key cryptography]], [[perfect forward secrecy]], and methods to prevent [[metadata]] leakage. The importance of secure communication has grown significantly in the digital age, particularly as awareness of mass surveillance programs and data collection practices has increased.

Beyond personal privacy, secure communication plays a crucial role in protecting journalist, activists, and individuals living under repressive regimes. It enables the free flow of information while maintaining confidentiality and protecting against censorship. The development of secure communication tools continues to evolve in response to new threats and technological capabilities, with ongoing efforts to make these tools more accessible and user-friendly while maintaining robust security standards. This field intersects with other privacy-enhancing technologies like [[VPN]]s, [[Tor]], and [[decentralized networks]].
