Counter-economics is a philosophical and practical approach to economic activity that operates outside state control, developed by Samuel Edward Konkin III as part of his theory of [[Agorism]]. It encompasses all peaceful economic activity that takes place in the informal sector, including black and grey markets, and is seen as a means of undermining state power through economic civil disobedience.

The concept forms the practical foundation of Agorism, proposing that individuals can gradually reduce state power by engaging in voluntary exchanges and business activities that circumvent government regulation, taxation, and control. This includes activities ranging from informal labor and barter to the development of alternative currencies and underground markets, all conducted through peaceful and voluntary means.

Counter-economics emphasizes the importance of building parallel economic structures that exist independently of state control. By participating in counter-economic activity, individuals can simultaneously protect their privacy, preserve their wealth from taxation, and contribute to the growth of a voluntary society. This approach aligns with both [[cryptocurrency]] adoption and the broader [[crypto-anarchist]] movement, as it promotes the development of tools and systems that enable economic freedom outside traditional state-controlled channels.
