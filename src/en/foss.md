Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) refers to software that is released under licenses that grant users the fundamental freedoms to run, study, modify, and distribute the software. This movement represents a revolutionary approach to software development and distribution that emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and user freedom. The core principles include access to the source code, the ability to make modifications, and the right to share the software with others, either in its original or modified form.

The FOSS movement emerged from two closely related but philosophically distinct communities: the *Free Software Movement*, founded by [Richard Stallman](/p/richard-stallman) and formalized through the *GNU Project* and *Free Software Foundation*, and the *Open Source Initiative*, which emphasizes the practical benefits of collaborative development. While free software emphasizes the ethical and social aspects of user freedom, open source focuses on the technical and economic advantages of open development methodologies. Both approaches have contributed to the creation of important software licenses like the *GPL* (GNU General Public License) and the *MIT License*.

The impact of FOSS has been profound, fundamentally changing how software is developed, distributed, and monetized. It has enabled the creation of critical infrastructure software like *Linux*, *Apache*, and countless other tools that power the modern internet and technology landscape. FOSS principles have also influenced other movements, including [[open hardware]], [[open data]], and [[creative commons]], while aligning with broader ideals of [[digital freedom]] and [[decentralization]]. The movement continues to be crucial in discussions about [[digital sovereignty|self-sovereignty]], [[privacy]], and resistance to proprietary software monopolies.
