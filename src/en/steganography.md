Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data or carriers in a way that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Unlike [[cryptography]], which makes a message unreadable but obvious that it exists, steganography aims to hide the very existence of the communication. The term comes from the Greek words "steganos" (covered or hidden) and "graphein" (writing), and its first recorded use was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his work "Steganographia."

Throughout history, steganography has taken many forms, from ancient methods like invisible ink and hidden tattoos to modern digital techniques. In the digital age, steganographic methods include hiding data within image files, audio files, network packets, or even social media posts. The technique can be combined with [[cryptography]] to provide an additional layer of security - even if the hidden message is discovered, it remains encrypted and unreadable without the proper decryption key.

While steganography has legitimate uses in [[privacy]], [[digital watermarking]], and secure communication, it has also raised concerns in the cybersecurity community due to its potential misuse. The technique is particularly relevant to the [[cypherpunk]] movement and [[digital privacy]] advocates as it provides a means of covert communication that resists surveillance. Modern steganography often employs sophisticated algorithms and techniques that leverage the properties of [[digital media]] formats to hide information in ways that are extremely difficult to detect.
