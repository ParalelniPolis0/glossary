Mesh networks are [[decentralized]] communication systems where each device (node) in the network connects to multiple other nodes, creating redundant paths for data transmission. Unlike traditional networks with centralized infrastructure, mesh networks can function without central control points, making them resilient to failure and [[censorship|censorship resistance]]. Each node in the network acts as both a user and a relay, helping to route data to its destination.

The key strength of mesh networks lies in their adaptability and resilience. If one node fails or becomes unavailable, data can automatically be rerouted through alternative paths. This architecture enables communities to build their own communication infrastructure independent of traditional Internet Service Providers. Modern mesh networks often use technologies like WiFi, Bluetooth, and LoRa to create interconnected webs of devices that can span neighborhoods or entire cities.

Mesh networks represent a practical implementation of [[decentralization]] principles in communication infrastructure. They're particularly valuable for maintaining connectivity during emergencies, enabling communication in areas lacking traditional infrastructure, and creating [[censorship-resistant|censorship resistance]] networks. Projects like *Briar*, *cjdns*, and various community wireless networks demonstrate how mesh networking can support [[digital autonomy]] and community resilience.
