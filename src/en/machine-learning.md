Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] that focuses on developing systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In the context of parallel structures and decentralized systems, ML has evolved to include approaches that distribute computation and learning across multiple nodes or participants, rather than relying on centralized processing. This decentralized approach aligns with principles of [[privacy]], [[security]], and resistance to central control.

A key development in decentralized ML is [[Federated Learning]], which allows multiple parties to train machine learning models collaboratively while keeping their data private and localized. This approach is particularly relevant to parallel structures as it enables the creation of robust learning systems that don't require centralized data collection or processing, preserving individual privacy and autonomy while still benefiting from collective intelligence.

The intersection of ML with [[blockchain]] technology and other decentralized systems has led to innovative applications in areas such as privacy-preserving AI, distributed decision-making, and autonomous organizations ([[DAOs]]). These systems demonstrate how machine learning can be implemented in ways that support rather than undermine individual sovereignty and privacy, making it a valuable tool for creating parallel structures that operate independently of traditional centralized institutions.
