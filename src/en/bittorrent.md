BitTorrent is a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication protocol for file sharing that enables users to distribute and share data in a decentralized manner. Instead of downloading files from a single centralized server, BitTorrent allows users to download pieces of files from multiple peers simultaneously, making the distribution process more efficient and resilient while reducing the bandwidth cost for the original distributor.

The protocol, created by Bram Cohen in 2001, works by breaking files into small pieces that can be downloaded in any order from different peers in the network. Users (called "peers") download pieces of the file they want while simultaneously uploading pieces they already have to other users, creating a collaborative distribution network. This system of reciprocity, where users both download and upload (known as "seeding"), is fundamental to the protocol's effectiveness and has influenced many subsequent [[decentralized]] systems.

BitTorrent's impact on digital culture and technology has been profound, demonstrating the viability of [[decentralized]] systems at scale. The protocol's success contributed to the rise of various movements including anti-copyright activism and digital rights discussions, while also influencing the development of blockchain technologies and other [[peer-to-peer]] systems. Its architecture has inspired many modern decentralized applications and protocols, showing how distributed systems can effectively replace traditional centralized structures.
