Pseudonymity is a state of operating under a pseudonym (a fake name or identifier) while maintaining a consistent identity over time. Unlike [[anonymity]], where an actor is completely unknown, pseudonymity allows individuals to build reputation, maintain relationships, and engage in long-term interactions while protecting their real identity. This concept is fundamental to many [[privacy]]-preserving systems and digital communities.

In digital spaces, pseudonymity enables users to participate in public discourse, conduct business, or build online presence without exposing their physical world identity. The persistence of pseudonymous identities allows for accountability and trust-building while maintaining privacy. Notable examples include [[Satoshi Nakamoto]], the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, and countless developers, writers, and activists who operate under consistent pseudonyms.

Pseudonymity is closely related to concepts like [[reputation systems]], [[digital identity]], and [[privacy-enhancing technologies]]. It's particularly important in [[cryptocurrency]] networks, where users operate through pseudonymous addresses, and in online communities where reputation and consistent identity matter. Technologies like [[digital signatures]] and [[zero-knowledge proofs]] help users prove ownership of their pseudonymous identities without revealing their real-world identities.
