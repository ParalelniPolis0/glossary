A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that runs on a [[blockchain]] network, automatically enforcing and executing the terms of an agreement between parties without the need for intermediaries. First proposed by *Nick Szabo* in 1994, smart contracts gained practical implementation with the launch of [[Ethereum]] in 2015, enabling automated, trustless transactions and interactions in a decentralized environment.

The key innovation of smart contracts lies in their ability to transform traditional contractual agreements into deterministic computer code that executes automatically when predefined conditions are met. This automation eliminates the need for trusted intermediaries, reduces costs, and minimizes the potential for fraud or manipulation. Smart contracts operate on a blockchain's immutable ledger, ensuring transparency and providing a verifiable history of all transactions and state changes.

Smart contracts have found applications across various industries, from [[DeFi]] (Decentralized Finance) protocols and [[NFT]] marketplaces to supply chain management and digital identity systems. They serve as the backbone for many [[dApp|decentralized applications]], enabling complex financial instruments, automated market makers, and governance systems for [[DAO|DAOs]]. However, they also face challenges related to security, scalability, and the immutable nature of deployed code, requiring careful development and auditing practices.
