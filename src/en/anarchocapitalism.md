Anarchocapitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates for the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and [[free markets]]. It combines anarchism's rejection of the state with capitalism's emphasis on private ownership and voluntary exchange.

At its core, anarchocapitalism proposes a society based on voluntary associations among individuals and private organizations. It argues that all goods and services, including law enforcement, courts, and defense, should be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation and government monopolies. Key principles include the [[non-aggression principle]] (NAP), which opposes the initiation of force against individuals or their property, and strong protection of [[property rights]].

Prominent thinkers associated with anarchocapitalism include [Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard), who developed its foundational theory, and [David Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Friedman), who approached it from a consequentialist perspective. The philosophy has influenced various movements, including some strands of [[libertarianism]] and [[crypto-anarchism]]. However, it has faced criticism from both traditional anarchists, who view capitalism as inherently hierarchical and oppressive, and from other political philosophies that argue for the necessity of the state in maintaining social order and providing public goods. Critics also question the practicality of private law and defense systems proposed by anarchocapitalists.
