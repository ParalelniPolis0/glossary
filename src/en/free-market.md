Free market refer to an economic system in which prices for goods and services are determined by open competition between privately owned businesses, without significant government intervention or regulation. This concept is fundamental to *classical liberalism* and *laissez-faire* economic theories, emphasizing voluntary exchange, private property rights, and minimal government interference in economic activities.

In a free market economy, supply and demand are the primary forces driving the allocation of resources, production decisions, and price determination. Proponents argue that this system leads to greater economic efficiency, innovation, and individual freedom. They contend that the "invisible hand" of the market, a concept introduced by *Adam Smith*, guides self-interested actors to produce socially beneficial outcomes. Free market advocates often support policies such as deregulation, privatization, and free trade.

Critics of free market ideology argue that unregulated markets can lead to *market failures*, extreme inequality, and environmental degradation. They contend that some level of government intervention is necessary to address externalities, provide public goods, and ensure fair competition. The debate between free market proponents and those advocating for various degrees of *market regulation* or alternative economic systems continues to shape political and economic discourse worldwide. In practice, most modern economies are *mixed systems* that combine elements of free markets with varying degrees of government intervention and regulation.
