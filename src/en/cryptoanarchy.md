Cryptoanarchy is a political philosophy and technological movement that advocates for the use of strong [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and privacy-enhancing technologies to advance individual liberty, economic freedom, and political autonomy. Emerging in the late 1980s with the [[Cypherpunk]] movement, cryptoanarchy draws inspiration from [[anarchist]] and [[libertarian]] ideals, as well as from technological innovations in computer science and cryptography.

Central to cryptoanarchist thought is the belief that widespread adoption of encryption, [anonymous networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_P2P), and [decentralized systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing) can fundamentally reshape social and economic structures by undermining state surveillance, censorship, and financial control. Key figures like [Timothy May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_C._May) and [Eric Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hughes_(cypherpunk)) laid the groundwork for the movement, advocating for tools such as [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [secure communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication), and [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) to create autonomous digital spaces beyond government reach.

The cryptoanarchist vision has significantly influenced technological development, inspiring projects like [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)), and [WikiLeaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks). However, the movement faces criticism for potentially enabling illegal activities and undermining necessary societal functions. The ongoing debate surrounding cryptoanarchy encompasses issues of [digital rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights), [online privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy), [financial regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_regulation), and the balance between individual freedom and collective security in the digital age.
