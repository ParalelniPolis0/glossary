Cryptoanarchy is a political philosophy and technological movement that advocates for the use of strong [[cryptography]] and privacy-enhancing technologies to advance individual liberty, economic freedom, and political autonomy. Emerging in the late 1980s with the [[Cypherpunk]] movement, cryptoanarchy draws inspiration from [[anarchist]] and [[libertarian]] ideals, as well as from technological innovations in computer science and cryptography.

Central to cryptoanarchist thought is the belief that widespread adoption of encryption, [[anonymous networks]], and [[decentralized systems]] can fundamentally reshape social and economic structures by undermining state surveillance, censorship, and financial control. Key figures like [Timothy C. May](/p/timothy-c-may) and [[Eric Hughes]] laid the groundwork for the movement, advocating for tools such as [[cryptocurrency]], [[secure communication]] protocols, and [[smart contracts]] to create autonomous digital spaces beyond government reach.

The cryptoanarchist vision has significantly influenced technological development, inspiring projects like [[Bitcoin]], [[Tor]], and [[WikiLeaks]]. However, the movement faces criticism for potentially enabling illegal activities and undermining necessary societal functions. The ongoing debate surrounding cryptoanarchy encompasses issues of digital rights, online privacy, financial regulation, and the balance between individual freedom and collective security in the digital age.
