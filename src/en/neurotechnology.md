Neurotechnology is an interdisciplinary field that combines neuroscience with technological innovation to develop systems that can interact directly with the nervous system. This emerging field encompasses a wide range of applications, from medical treatments and neural prosthetics to brain-computer interfaces and cognitive enhancement technologies. The core aim is to understand, monitor, and influence neural activity to improve human health, capabilities, and experience.

The field includes several key applications such as [[neural interfaces]], [[neuroprosthetics]], [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS), and [[neurobiofeedback]]. These technologies are being used to treat neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and paralysis, while also showing promise in enhancing cognitive functions and enabling direct brain-to-computer communication. The development of these technologies relies heavily on advances in [[artificial intelligence]], [[machine learning]], and [[microelectronics]].

As neurotechnology continues to advance, it raises important ethical considerations regarding [[privacy]], [[consent]], and human enhancement. The ability to directly interface with and potentially modify neural activity presents both tremendous opportunities and significant challenges for society. This intersection with ethics and human rights has led to discussions about [[neuroethics]] and the need for appropriate governance frameworks to ensure responsible development and deployment of these technologies. The field is closely related to movements like [[transhumanism]] and [[biohacking]], which explore human enhancement and the future of human-technology integration.
