A darknet is an overlay network within the Internet that can only be accessed with specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard communication protocols and ports. The most famous darknet is the [[Tor]] network, which provides anonymity by encrypting and routing internet traffic through a worldwide network of volunteer servers. Darknets are a key component of the "Dark Web" - websites that are not indexed by traditional search engines and require special software to access.

The technology behind darknets was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the 1990s to protect intelligence communications. Today, darknets serve multiple purposes, from protecting privacy and circumventing [[censorship|censorship resistance]] in authoritarian regimes to enabling [[whistleblowing]] and secure communication. The technology relies on various [[cryptographic|cryptography]] protocols and [[peer-to-peer]] networking to ensure user anonymity and data security.

While darknets have legitimate uses in protecting [[privacy]] and freedom of speech, they have also gained notoriety for hosting illegal activities. However, this represents only a portion of darknet usage. The technology continues to evolve and play a crucial role in the [[cypherpunk]] movement's goal of protecting digital rights and privacy. Darknets are often used in conjunction with other privacy-enhancing technologies like [[VPN]]s and [[encryption]] tools to create secure communication channels outside traditional internet infrastructure.
