Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized [[cryptocurrency]], introduced in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]]. It operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] network without the need for intermediaries, using [[blockchain]] technology to maintain a public ledger of all transactions. Bitcoin was created as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, aiming to provide a currency independent of central banks and government control.

The core innovation of Bitcoin lies in its solution to the [[double-spending problem]] and its [[consensus mechanism]] known as [[Proof of Work]]. This system allows for secure, verifiable transactions without a trusted third party. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, with new bitcoins created through a process called [[mining|cryptocurrency mining]], where powerful computers solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

Since its inception, Bitcoin has grown from a niche interest among cryptography enthusiasts to a global financial phenomenon. It has inspired the creation of thousands of other cryptocurrencies and sparked debates about the future of money, financial privacy, and monetary policy. While proponents view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a tool for financial sovereignty, critics point to its price volatility, environmental concerns due to energy-intensive mining, and its use in illicit activities. Despite controversies, Bitcoin continues to evolve, with developments like the [[Lightning Network]] aiming to address scalability issues.
