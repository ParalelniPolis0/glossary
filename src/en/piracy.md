Piracy, in the digital context, refers to the unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of copyrighted digital content such as software, music, movies, books, and other media. While traditionally viewed as illegal by mainstream institutions and copyright holders, some within parallel structure movements see it as a form of [[information freedom]] and resistance against restrictive intellectual property regimes. This tension highlights the ongoing debate between proprietary control and the free flow of information in the digital age.

From a [[crypto-anarchist]] perspective, piracy can be seen as a practical implementation of counter-economic principles, creating parallel distribution networks that operate outside traditional market structures. These networks, often utilizing [[peer-to-peer]] technologies and [[encryption]], demonstrate how decentralized systems can emerge to challenge established institutional control over information distribution. The development of technologies like [[BitTorrent]] and various file-sharing platforms has been significantly influenced by this dynamic.

The impact of digital piracy extends beyond simple economic considerations into questions of [[digital rights]], [[information accessibility]], and the nature of ownership in the digital age. While mainstream discourse often focuses on its negative economic effects, advocates within parallel structure movements emphasize its role in preserving cultural heritage, promoting information equality, and resisting [[digital rights management]] (DRM) and other restrictive measures. This has led to the development of various [[decentralized storage]] solutions and content distribution networks that prioritize information freedom.
