A hackerspace (also known as a hackspace or makerspace) is a community-operated physical workspace where people with common interests in technology, digital art, science, and [[DIY]] culture can meet, socialize, collaborate, and work on projects. These spaces typically provide tools, equipment, and resources that might be too expensive or impractical for individuals to own, ranging from 3D printers and laser cutters to electronics workstations and traditional workshop tools.

The hackerspace movement emerged from the [[hacker culture]] and [[cypherpunk]] communities of the 1990s, with early spaces appearing in Germany and spreading globally. The concept emphasizes peer learning, knowledge sharing, and the democratization of technology through hands-on experimentation. Hackerspaces often operate on principles of [[open source]] collaboration, [[decentralization]], and community governance, making them natural allies of movements focused on technological freedom and autonomy.

Modern hackerspaces serve as important nodes in the broader [[maker culture]] ecosystem, fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological literacy. They frequently host workshops, hackathons, and educational events, creating bridges between various communities including artists, engineers, activists, and educators. Notable examples include *Noisebridge* in San Francisco and c-base in Berlin, which specifically focuses on privacy technology.
