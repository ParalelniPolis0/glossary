Censorship resistance is a fundamental property of decentralized networks that prevents any entity, whether governments, corporations, or individuals, from altering, blocking, or controlling transactions and information flow within the system. This characteristic is achieved through decentralization, cryptography, and consensus mechanisms that ensure no single party can exert unilateral control over the network. [[Bitcoin]] is often considered the most censorship-resistant cryptocurrency due to its highly decentralized nature.

The concept emerged as a core principle of [[cryptocurrency]] networks, drawing from [[cypherpunk]] ideals of privacy and freedom from institutional control. Censorship resistance works through a combination of technical features: [[cryptography]] protects communications and transactions, [[distributed networks]] prevent single points of failure, and economic incentives encourage network participants to maintain the system's integrity rather than attempt to censor it.

In practice, censorship resistance exists on a spectrum, with more decentralized systems generally offering stronger protection against interference. This property has become increasingly important in an era of digital surveillance and control, as it enables individuals to transact and communicate freely without permission from central authorities. The concept extends beyond just financial transactions to include resistance against content censorship, making it crucial for preserving digital freedom and [[privacy]] in various applications of [[blockchain]] technology.
