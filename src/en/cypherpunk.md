Cypherpunk is a political and social movement that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, advocating for the use of strong [[cryptography]] and privacy-enhancing technologies as a means to achieve social and political change. The term "cypherpunk" is a combination of "cipher" (or "cypher") and "[[cyberpunk]]". Cypherpunks believe that privacy is essential for an open society in the electronic age and see strong cryptography as a tool to preserve civil liberties against government overreach and corporate surveillance.

At its core, Cypherpunk philosophy is characterized by a distrust of authority, advocacy for [[privacy]] as a fundamental right, and the belief that code can be used to create systems that enforce desired social and political norms. This ideology was formalized in the [[Cypherpunk's Manifesto]], written by Eric Hughes in 1993. Notable figures associated with the cypherpunk movement include [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), [Adam Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back), and [Wei Dai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Dai).

The impact of cypherpunk philosophy has been significant, influencing the development of [[cryptocurrencies]] like [[Bitcoin]], anonymous communication systems such as [[Tor]], and advancing encryption technologies. It continues to play a crucial role in ongoing debates about digital privacy, surveillance, and individual sovereignty in the digital age. The philosophy emphasizes the creation of parallel, decentralized structures that prioritize privacy, freedom, and individual autonomy in the face of increasing digital surveillance and control.
