Information Ethics is a branch of ethics that focuses on the relationship between the creation, organization, dissemination, and use of information, and the ethical standards and moral codes governing human conduct in society. It addresses the moral issues arising from the lifecycle of information, particularly in the context of the digital age where data collection, processing, and sharing have become ubiquitous. The field examines questions about [[privacy]], accessibility, intellectual property, and the social impact of information technologies.

At its core, Information Ethics is concerned with principles such as transparency, accountability, fairness, and respect for individual rights in the handling of information. These principles guide decisions about what information should be collected, how it should be stored and protected, who should have access to it, and how it should be used. The field has become increasingly important as [[digital technologies]] and [[artificial intelligence]] raise new ethical challenges around issues like algorithmic bias, surveillance, data protection, and the right to be forgotten.

The practical applications of Information Ethics extend across many domains including healthcare ([[medical privacy]]), business ([[corporate responsibility]]), government ([[digital governance]]), and education ([[digital literacy]]). It provides frameworks for addressing ethical dilemmas in information management and helps shape policies and guidelines for responsible information handling. The field continues to evolve as new technologies emerge, requiring constant reassessment of ethical principles in light of changing technological capabilities and societal needs.
