Digital Freedom refers to the fundamental rights and liberties of individuals in the digital realm, encompassing the ability to access, use, create, and publish digital media while maintaining privacy and autonomy. It represents the extension of basic human rights and civil liberties into the digital space, including freedom of expression, right to privacy, and access to information through digital technologies, particularly the Internet.

At its core, digital freedom is built on the principle that the rights we enjoy offline should be equally protected online. This includes protection against [[surveillance]], [[censorship]], and digital authoritarianism, while promoting [[privacy]], security, and individual autonomy in digital spaces. Organizations like the *Electronic Frontier Foundation* and various digital rights groups work to defend these freedoms through advocacy, education, and technological innovation.

The concept has become increasingly important as our lives become more digitally integrated, with implications for democracy, human rights, and social justice. Digital freedom intersects with various technological and social movements, including [[cypherpunk]], [[cryptocurrency]], and [[privacy]] advocacy, which aim to create tools and systems that preserve individual liberty in the digital age. The struggle for digital freedom often involves resisting both government overreach and corporate surveillance while promoting decentralized, privacy-preserving alternatives.
