Digital autonomy refers to the ability of individuals, organizations, or nations to maintain independence and control over their digital technologies, data, and infrastructure. It encompasses the capacity to make sovereign decisions about technological systems while reducing dependence on external entities or proprietary solutions. This concept has become increasingly important in an era where digital technologies are deeply embedded in all aspects of life, from personal privacy to national security.

A key aspect of digital autonomy is the use of [[open source]] software and hardware, which provides transparency, customization abilities, and freedom from vendor lock-in. This approach aligns closely with [[cypherpunk]] ideals of technological self-determination and privacy. Digital autonomy also involves developing local technological capabilities, maintaining control over critical digital infrastructure, and ensuring [[data sovereignty]] - the ability to maintain authority over how data is collected, processed, and stored.

The pursuit of digital autonomy often intersects with other parallel structures and movements, including [[decentralization]], [[cryptography]], and [[self-sovereign identity]]. It emphasizes the importance of technological literacy, independent infrastructure, and the ability to opt out of centralized digital systems when desired. This concept is particularly relevant in discussions about [[digital rights]], [[privacy]], and resistance to technological surveillance and control by governments or large corporations.
