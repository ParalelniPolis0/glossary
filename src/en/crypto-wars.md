The Crypto Wars refers to the ongoing political and legal battles between governments (particularly the United States) and advocates of strong [[encryption]], centered around attempts to restrict or control public access to cryptographic technologies. This conflict emerged prominently in the 1990s when the US government tried to maintain control over encryption through export controls and proposals like the [[Clipper Chip]], setting off a debate between national security interests and digital privacy rights that continues today.

The first major phase of the Crypto Wars occurred in the 1990s, when the US government treated strong encryption as a form of munition, requiring export licenses and attempting to mandate "backdoors" for law enforcement access. This period saw significant resistance from [[cypherpunk]]s, technology companies, and civil liberties groups who argued that strong encryption was essential for privacy, commerce, and democracy in the digital age. The debate culminated in the relaxation of export controls in 2000, marking a victory for encryption advocates.

The concept of Crypto Wars has experienced a resurgence in recent years, sometimes called "Crypto Wars 2.0," as governments worldwide continue to seek ways to access encrypted communications in the name of law enforcement and national security. This ongoing tension reflects fundamental questions about the balance between individual privacy and state power in the digital age, touching on issues like [[end-to-end encryption]], [[backdoors]], and the role of [[surveillance]] in modern society. The debate has become increasingly relevant with the rise of [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] and other privacy-enhancing technologies.
